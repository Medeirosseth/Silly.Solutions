<details>
  <summary>Setup/installation Requirements:open_file_folder:</summary>
  
  ### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to run and interact with the console app.
- [MySQL Community Server][https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/account/Silly.Solution`
2. Navigate to the `Silly.Solution/` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To setup a SQL database using MySQL:
   - Create an `appsettings.json` file in the `{Factory}` directory
   - Copy the text box below and paste into the `appsettings.json` file, replacing `<password>` with your MySQL password:
     {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=tiffany_greathead;uid=root;pwd=<password>;"
     }
     }
   - Open your terminal and run the command: `mysql -uroot -p<mysql_password>` (replace `<mysql_password>` with your MySQL password) and select the enter key to launch MySQL servers
   - Type the following commands to setup the database:
     - `CREATE DATABASE Salon;` to make a new database
     - `USE Salon;` to connect to the new database
     - `CREATE TABLE {template_category (TemplateCategory INT, SomeProperty VARCHAR (255))};` to create a `{template_category}` table
     - `CREATE TABLE {template_item (TemplateItemId INT, TemplateCategoryId Int)};` to create another new `{template_item}` table
5. To run the console app:
   - Navigate to `{Salon.Solution/HairSalon}` in your command line
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `{Template.csproj}`
   - Run the command `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
   - Run the command `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
   - Run the command `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
   - Run the command `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the console app
6. Visit the application via web browser at: `localhost:5000/`
